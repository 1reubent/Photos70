<h1>Photo Management Application</h1>
<p>This application allows users to manage photo albums, add and remove photos, tag photos with metadata, create their
  own tag types and search photos by date or tag. The user interface is built using JavaFX, and the application follows
  the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.</p>
<p>The application supports features such as user management, album management, photo viewing, slideshow mode, and
  more.</p>
<h2>Persistence and Data Storage</h2>
<p>
  The application uses Java's built-in object serialization to persist user data and application state.
  When the application is closed, all app data user accounts, albums, photos, and associated metadata are serialized
  and saved to the disk in one file <code>photos_app_data.dat</code>. Upon startup, the application reads this file and restores
  the data in memory, ensuring a seamless user experience between sessions.
</p>
<p>
  The persistence is managed in the <code>Photos</code> driver class, which provides methods
  for saving and loading data, abstracting away file handling details from other parts of the application.
